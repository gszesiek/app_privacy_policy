Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 5, 2026 Developer: gszesiek

This privacy policy applies to all mobile applications (hereinafter referred to as "Applications") published by gszesiek on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

1. Data Collection and Usage

My Applications are designed with a "privacy-first" approach.

Personal Data: The Applications do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data (such as name, email address, phone number, or GPS location).

Non-Personal Data: I do not collect any analytical or statistical data regarding how you use the Applications.

2. Advertising

The Applications are completely ad-free. I do not use any advertising networks or third-party services (e.g., AdMob, Facebook Ads) that could track user activity.

3. Permissions

If an Application requests access to device features (e.g., camera, storage), these permissions are used solely to perform the Application's core functions locally on your device. No files or data accessed through these permissions are sent to external servers.

4. Third-Party Services

The Applications do not use external APIs, SDKs, or cloud services that could collect user information. All data processing occurs exclusively on your device (on-device processing).

5. Children's Privacy

Since the Applications do not collect any personal data, they are safe for users of all ages, including children. I do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update this policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page. I encourage you to review this document periodically.

7. Contact
